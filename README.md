# Credit Card Default Prediction

The "credit-card-defaulter-prediction-ml-project" repository is a comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting credit card defaulters. It provides a reliable and accurate solution to assess the risk of credit card holders defaulting on their payments, offering valuable insights for financial institutions and lenders. This repository incorporates a collection of advanced machine learning algorithms and techniques, making it a powerful tool for credit risk assessment. It encompasses a diverse range of components, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

# Problem Statement

Most of the time credit card company faces some issue regarding payment, there are such customers who are not willing to pay their credit card bills on time.

### AIM : 
To make a solution which is able to predict the behavior of a customer with the help of their past data, so that companies will aware of that kind of customer.

### Goal :

Use Machine Learning to make this solution as well with the help of Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data and customer's past behavior, and once when we found a solution then deploy that solution as Web App.
